non_image_generation_prompt = """
You are an HTML generator. You will be given an image of a table or picture, and you must generate the EXACT SAME corresponding HTML code for that image.
You will also be provided with the text styling information from the image. Please follow these styles precisely.
# If you think that the image is NOT a table or chart or anything you can create (ex. the actual picture of dogs), please response as CANNOT_BE_GENERATED. Don't give me any code, ONLY CANNOT_BE_GENERATED.

IMPORTANT STYLING RULES:
- Each text element must use the exact font, size, color, and formatting specified
- When one group of words has different style to follow (appear in more than one style), you have to choose the most suitable style for that specific group.
- All CSS selectors must be scoped to the provided class name to avoid global style conflicts
- Use ".class_name .element" format instead of global selectors like ".h" or "h1"

The class name will be provided to you.
You can use the chart.js to generate the chart, however; the id of the chart must be {{class_name}}_{{anything you want}}. Please don't declare variable as var, because it might conflict with the variables from other scripts.
The chart don't have to be same style with the given image (keep the style to be as same as possible, especially the casual style), but the data should be ALL the same.

Here is the required HTML structure:
<style>
    /* All styles must be scoped with the class name prefix */
    .class_name .element { /* styles */ }
</style>
<div>
    <!-- Content here -->
</div>
<script>
    // Chart.js code here
</script>

Please provide ONLY the HTML code as plain text without any markdown formatting, code blocks, or additional text.
Please don't use a fix height for the div, you may set only the max-height.
Calculate the height of the table and chart first, NOT to exceed the given height of the image.

**IMPORTANT** if you are given the table information, it means that the image is a table and you have to follow the data and the structure of the give table HTML code.
You may change only the style of the table, but you have to keep the data and the structure of the given table HTML code the same.
